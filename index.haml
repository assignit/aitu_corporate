      %a{name:'rodeo'}Cognos not a fit for you? 
    %h1 We can still help.
    %p We're no one trick pony. 
    %p If you're looking for a reporting or analytics solution and have found that the options aren't a great fit or too expensive, we can still help.
    %p Don't get us wrong, software like Cognos have their place, but they're designed to be everything to everyone, and that can leave your business out in the cold.
    .p 
      %span We've designed and built 
      %a.tip Rodeo, 
      .tooltiptext      
        %p 
          In case you're wondering, Rodeo stands for Reports On Demand, Extensible & Open  
      %span which is a simple but powerful data warehouse, reporting and analysis framework.
    .p 
      %span Our framework allows you to build only what you need, with no added fluff. It's also better than building from scratch, as our framework's stack is built from 
      %a.tip proven, open source technologies.

    %p 
      And the best part of our solution, is that your software licenses have 
      %b zero cost. 
      Yes, you read that right. 
    %p Because you are using open source software, there's no up front cost for the software. There are also no annual maintenance or major version upgrade fees. 
    %p You only pay us for the services work to build what you need.
    %p Rodeo is built for companies that need a powerful reporting solution but without the huge costs required to just get a foot in the door.

      %a{name:'aitm'}Struggling to rein in your projects? 
    %h1 We've got something for that too.
    %p In our years of running projects, we were never able to find a project management tool that was well suited to the challenges of running a consulting firm.  
    %p Inevitably, the software out there would get some things right, and other things horribly wrong. 
    %p In the end, we took matters into our own hands and rolled our  own solution, Assign It To Me.  
    %p 
      %span.needs-work We used our background in analytics to develop a system that gives us a high level snapshot of our projects' health.
    %p Assign it to me is a web-based, mobile friendly tool that helps consulting firms like ours run projects profitably and successfully.
    %p We put our money where our mouth is, and we use Assign It To Me on all of our engagements.
    %p 
      For more details, visit the Assign It To Me site, or, 
      %a{href:'mailto:info@assignittous.com'} just give us a shout.
