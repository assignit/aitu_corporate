      This page should answer the three most common things people are coming to the site for.
    
      Steven's guesses for why people would come to our site:
      
      1. They are wondering who we are. They = competitors, prospects, friends and former colleagues
      1. They are looking for contact information. They = same as above + spammers + and people who want to sell us crap + headhunters
      1. They are looking for a BI solution or consulting
      1. They are looking for help with Cognos
      1. They are looking for info on Assign It To Me
      1. They are looking for our "We'll Show You How" screencasts

      We should think about the ratio of computer vs mobile visits to the site with respect to any wizziness to the page.
      
      I'm guessing it's going to be 50% or higher in favor of mobile.

  <!-- hero block, this is where the "who are we?" primary value statement is -->
  
  %h1 We help companies make better decisions.
  
  %h3 Our solutions turn raw business data into insightful information.

    The goal of the hero block above is to summarize what we do in two pithy, jargon-free sentences.

  Note that a carousel isn't mobile friendly. Might just want to put the content in-line and have users scroll to read it.

  Perhaps each teaser question should address the three or four most common things people are coming here for.
  
  My first kick at the can:
  
  1. Someone to help them with Cognos - the supporting text should link to appropriate place on Services page and to the We'll Show You How screencasts page
  2. Someone to help them implement *any* BI solution
  3. ?? Looking for a profitability solution ?? redirect to AITM 
  4. ?? ??
