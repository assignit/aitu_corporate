      Note that the styling and js logic are just roughed in. There's a lot of polish to be done.
      
      This is just a proof of concept.
      
      In the actual popup we should have a 'fine print' tab with a bunch of disclaimer bullet points.

    ## Overview-Option-A
    
    After years of delivering IBM Cognos solutions, we noticed a pattern with our interactions with prospective and 
    existing customers. 
    
    *go on about common pain points like:*
    
    * Having to spend a lot of time hacking Cognos to do something relatively simple would take much longer than coding something from scratch
    * It was hard to convince prospective customers about the value of spending 5 to 6 figures on the infrastructure and software portion of a bi solution
    * Hard to find good people to work on Cognos
    * Once people at customers trained up on Cognos, they'd leave for greener pastures
    * A lot of Cognos people only know Cognos, which resulted in sub-optimal solutions
    * We figured out how to fix a lot of problems before Cognos support did
    * Cognos offered limited automation for deployment
    * You have to pay extra for developer and staging licenses
    * Reuse of code etc. is very hard with Cognos stuff

    
    ## Overview-Option-B
    
    After years of using Cognos, we realized that it would sometimes be faster to build something from scratch than to use 
    Cognos' built-in functionality. While Cognos is a good tool, it is designed to be "adequate at everything" but not great at 
    any one particular thing. 
    
    Time and time again, we would encounter edge cases that were difficult to develop using Cognos' built-in functionality. 
    The problems themselves tended to be relatively simple, but were time consuming to implement "the Cognos Way".
    
    This was a seminal moment for our product. We realized that the state of open source tools in the analytics world had 
    matured to the point where they could be used in production. We familiarized ourselves with various tools and languages 
    to be able to make a framework for building custom business intelligence solutions quickly.
    
    We call it... *insert name here*
    
    ## The Stack
    
    The way we've designed our stack, and all of our solutions, for that matter, is to separate responsibilities of each 
    part of the solution. *this is badly worded*
    
    By isolating the activities that each part of the stack can do, we ensure that the solution is more maintainable and..
