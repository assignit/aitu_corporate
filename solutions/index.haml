    This was a seminal moment for our product. We realized that the state of open source tools in the analytics world had 
    matured to the point where they could be used in production. We familiarized ourselves with various tools and languages 
    to be able to make a framework for building custom business intelligence solutions quickly.
    
    We call it... *insert name here*
    
    ## The Stack
    
    The way we've designed our stack, and all of our solutions, for that matter, is to separate responsibilities of each 
    part of the solution. *this is badly worded*
    
    By isolating the activities that each part of the stack can do, we ensure that the solution is more maintainable and..
