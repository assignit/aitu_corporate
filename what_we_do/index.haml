      # Goals for this section (delete when this section is considered complete)
      
      1. Communicate that we do cognos -- accomplished by the headline
      2. Communicate that we are good at cognos - accomplished by paragraphs 1, 5, 6
      3. Explain why we are better than our competition -- accomplished by paragraphs  3, 4, 5, 7
      4. Call to action (contact us) -- accomplished by last paragraph
      
  %h2 We do Cognos   
    
  %p 
    We've spent a good part of the last decade delivering Cognos solutions for businesses of all sizes in 
    %a.popper{href: '#',
      'data-original-title' => 'Industries',
      'data-content' => '<ul><li>Automotive<li>Education<li>Health Care<li>Manufacturing</ul>'} 
      many industries. 
    Much of that time was spent pushing Cognos to its limits. 
  %p So why hire us?     
    
  %p A lot of Cognos experts out there are simply that. <i>Experts at Cognos, and not much else</i>.
    
  %p The thing is, the hard part about a Cognos project has less to do with what Cognos can do than what it <b>can't</b> do.
    
  %p We're good at Cognos, but isn't because of our knowledge of Cognos. We're good at Cognos because we also know and understand the technologies that support and surround Cognos.
    
  %p
    We know data warehouses and 
    
    %a.popper{href: '#',
      'data-original-title' => 'Databases',
      'data-content' => '<ul><li>PostgreSQL<li>MySQL<li>Microsoft SQL Server<li>Oracle<li>DB2<li>AS400<li>MongoDB<li>Lotus Domino</ul>'} databases.    
    We know that some problems are best solved with 
    %a.popper{href: '#',
      'data-original-title' => 'Industries',
      'data-content' => '<ul><li>Automotive<li>Education<li>Health Care<li>Manufacturing</ul>'} raw SQL.

    We know 
    %a.popper{href: '#',
      'data-original-title' => 'Root Cause Analysis',
      'data-content' => '<ul><li>Automotive<li>Education<li>Health Care<li>Manufacturing</ul>'} root cause analysis. 
    We know how to 
    %a.popper{href: '#',
      'data-original-title' => 'Languages',
      'data-content' => '<ul><li>Javascript<li>Visual Basic<li>Visual Basic for Applications<li>Coffeescript<li>SQL<li>Ruby etc.</ul>'} code.    
    
    And we 
    %a.popper{href: '#',
      'data-original-title' => 'Working Smart',
      'data-content' => '<ul><li>Javascript<li>Visual Basic<li>Visual Basic for Applications<li>Coffeescript<li>SQL<li>Ruby etc.</ul>'} work smart.    

    
  %p
    Most importantly, we're more interested in helping you solve your problems than selling you software licenses. If there's a nail that 
    the Cognos hammer can't hit, we probably have 
    %a.popper{href: '#',
      'data-original-title' => 'Other Tools',
      'data-content' => 'Some verbiage about open source tools here.'} a hammer.    
    in our toolbox that can.

      What are the goals for the content here, and how do we know we've met them? # Goals for this section (delete when this section is considered complete)
      
      1. Explain what we do -- our framework.
      2. Explain why our solution is good for the reader when Cognos is not the fit
      3. Call to action (visit microsite & contact us)
        
  %h2 Cognos not a fit for you? We can still help.
  
  %p 
    We don't just do Cognos, we 
    %a.popper{href: '#',
      'data-original-title' => 'Other Services',
      'data-content' => '<ul><li>Data Warehousing<li>ETL<li>Custom Web Applications<li>Custom Analytics Solutions</ul>'} a lot of other things
    too.    
    
  %p 
    If you're looking for a reporting or analytics solution and have found that the commercial alternatives like Cognos 
    just aren't a fit for you, <b>we might just be able to solve your problem</b>.
  
  %p We've designed and built <i>[insert name here]</i> which is a simple but powerful data warehouse, reporting and analysis framework.
  
  %p 
    We built <i>[insert name here]</i> because we encountered a lot of businesses who got sticker shock over the price of commercial 
    business intelligence software, and for ourselves, because we got tired of using tools that made us mutter "I could write this from scratch 
    faster than I could using this tool" under our breaths. 
  %p
    Don't get us wrong, software like Cognos have their place, but they're designed to be everything to everyone, which 
    sometimes that leaves your business out in the cold.
  
  %p 
    Our framework allows you to build only what you need, with no added fluff. It's also better than building from scratch, as our 
    framework's stack is built from 
    %a.popper{href: '#',
      'data-original-title' => 'Our Stack',
      'data-content' => '<ul><li>CentOS Linux<li>PostgreSQL<li>Scriptella (ETL)<li>Ruby on Rails<li>...</ul>'} proven, open source technologies.

  %p And the best part of our solution, is that your software licenses have <b>zero cost</b>. Yes, you read that right. Zero cost software. 
  
  %p 
    Because you are using open source software, there's no up front cost for the software. There's also no annual maintenance fees. And, if you 
    need to make a software upgrade, there's no charge for that either. If you want to plug in some software pieces that you've already paid for,
    that's okay too.
  
  %p <i>You only pay for the services work to build what you need.</i>
  
  %p 
    <i>[insert name here]</i> is built for companies that need 
    %a.popper{href: '#',
      'data-original-title' => 'Our Solution Includes',
      'data-content' => '<ul><li>a data warehouse<li>...</ul>'} a powerful reporting solution
    but without the huge costs required to just get a foot in the door.

  .annotation.s 
    maybe the paragraph below is better for the micro site?
  %p
    If you choose to go with a custom solution with us, you get a data warehouse from the get go. Instead of using some meta-tool like a
    "framework manager" and having to continually tweak it to make it give you the proper results quickly, we do direct transformation of your data in
    a data warehouse. This is faster, more maintainable, and more reliable. It's also cheaper to develop, believe it or not. We use advanced licence free
    software wherever possible which minimizes your implementation costs.

      What are the goals for the content here, and how do we know we've met them? # Goals for this section (delete when this section is considered complete)
      
      1. Explain what we do -- address project management pain point, Control of projects, costs, profitability
      2. Explain why we built the app. Explain why we use it
      3. Call to action
      
      
  %h2 Finding it harder and harder to keep your projects under control? We've got something for that too.
  
  %p After years of consulting, we still couldn't find a good tool to run our projects well.
  
  %p Gantt charts and to-do lists only take you so far. When you're running a consulting business, you need a good grasp of your costs and how <i>well</i> your projects are going.
  
  %p 
    We got tired of using 
    %a.popper{href: '#',
      'data-original-title' => 'Our Hodgepodge',
      'data-content' => '<ul><li>Excel<li>Word<li>Microsoft Project<li>Time Tracking System</ul>'} a hodgepodge of tools
    to get only passable information about how well our engagements were going. Things would inevitably fall through the cracks, and it affected our 
    ability to please our customers at the level we wanted to.

  %p 
    Not only that, it was making it hard to know if our projects were making money, or at risk of losing money.

  %p 
    So we decided to take matters into our own hands, and created Assign It To Me. We used our background in analytics to develop a system that 
    [stuff about project health, spotting red flags, and integrating time and status?]
    
  %p
    Assign it to me is a web-based, mobile friendly tool that helps consulting firms like ours run their projects profitably and successfully.

  %p
    We put our money where our mouth is, and we use Assign It To Me on all of 
    %a.popper{href: '#',
      'data-original-title' => 'Our Hodgepodge',
      'data-content' => "We want to do everything possible to make your services projects successful. For every customer that signs up for our services, we'll also sign them up for a free one-year subscription for X project managers to our project management app Assign It To Me (that's a ## savings). Use it to manage all you projects forever.  "} 
      our engagements.

  %p
    We all know that delivering a successful project is the primary focus for project managers and their teams. They should not be wasting valuable time on administrative tasks
    when there is more important work to do.
  %p
    All managers are aware that administrative tasks should be kept to a minimum and Assign It To Me does that with an easy to use workspace. Project managers can see how their project is progressing with
    integrated status reports and project health dashboards. Team members no longer have to use multiple systems on a project. Task management, communication,
    timekeeping, status reports, scope control and work load are all integrated into one tool.

  %p If you run a consulting shop like ours, Assign It To Me.
