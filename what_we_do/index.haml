  %h2 We do Cognos   
    
  %p 
    We've spent a good part of the last decade delivering Cognos solutions for businesses of all sizes in 
    %a.popper{href: '#',
      'data-original-title' => 'Industries',
      'data-content' => '<ul><li>Automotive<li>Education<li>Health Care<li>Manufacturing</ul>'} 
      many industries. 
    Much of that time was spent pushing Cognos to its limits. 
  %p So why hire us?     
    
  %p A lot of Cognos experts out there are simply that. <i>Experts at Cognos, and not much else</i>.
    
  %p The thing is, the hard part about a Cognos project has less to do with what Cognos can do than what it <b>can't</b> do.
    
  %p We're good at Cognos, but isn't because of our knowledge of Cognos. We're good at Cognos because we also know and understand the technologies that support and surround Cognos.
    
  %p
    We know data warehouses and 
    
    %a.popper{href: '#',
      'data-original-title' => 'Databases',
      'data-content' => '<ul><li>PostgreSQL<li>MySQL<li>Microsoft SQL Server<li>Oracle<li>DB2<li>AS400<li>MongoDB<li>Lotus Domino</ul>'} databases.    
    We know that some problems are best solved with 
    %a.popper{href: '#',
      'data-original-title' => 'Industries',
      'data-content' => '<ul><li>Automotive<li>Education<li>Health Care<li>Manufacturing</ul>'} raw SQL.

    We know 
    %a.popper{href: '#',
      'data-original-title' => 'Root Cause Analysis',
      'data-content' => '<ul><li>Automotive<li>Education<li>Health Care<li>Manufacturing</ul>'} root cause analysis. 
    We know how to 
    %a.popper{href: '#',
      'data-original-title' => 'Languages',
      'data-content' => '<ul><li>Javascript<li>Visual Basic<li>Visual Basic for Applications<li>Coffeescript<li>SQL<li>Ruby etc.</ul>'} code.    
    
    And we 
    %a.popper{href: '#',
      'data-original-title' => 'Working Smart',
      'data-content' => '<ul><li>Javascript<li>Visual Basic<li>Visual Basic for Applications<li>Coffeescript<li>SQL<li>Ruby etc.</ul>'} work smart.    

    
  %p
    Most importantly, we're more interested in helping you solve your problems than selling you software licenses. If there's a nail that 
    the Cognos hammer can't hit, we probably have 
    %a.popper{href: '#',
      'data-original-title' => 'Other Tools',
      'data-content' => 'Some verbiage about open source tools here.'} a hammer.    
    in our toolbox that can.

  %h2 Cognos not a fit for you? We can still help.
  
  %p 
    We don't just do Cognos, we 
    %a.popper{href: '#',
      'data-original-title' => 'Other Services',
      'data-content' => '<ul><li>Data Warehousing<li>ETL<li>Custom Web Applications<li>Custom Analytics Solutions</ul>'} a lot of other things
    too.    
    
  %p 
    If you're looking for a reporting or analytics solution and have found that the commercial alternatives like Cognos 
    just aren't a fit for you, <b>we might just be able to solve your problem</b>.
  
  %p We've designed and built <i>[insert name here]</i> which is a simple but powerful data warehouse, reporting and analysis framework.
  
  %p 
    We built <i>[insert name here]</i> because we encountered a lot of businesses who got sticker shock over the price of commercial 
    business intelligence software, and for ourselves, because we got tired of using tools that made us mutter "I could write this from scratch 
    faster than I could using this tool" under our breaths. 
  %p
    Don't get us wrong, software like Cognos have their place, but they're designed to be everything to everyone, which 
    sometimes that leaves your business out in the cold.
  
  %p 
    Our framework allows you to build only what you need, with no added fluff. It's also better than building from scratch, as our 
    framework's stack is built from 
    %a.popper{href: '#',
      'data-original-title' => 'Our Stack',
      'data-content' => '<ul><li>CentOS Linux<li>PostgreSQL<li>Scriptella (ETL)<li>Ruby on Rails<li>...</ul>'} proven, open source technologies.

  %p And the best part of our solution, is that your software licenses have <b>zero cost</b>. Yes, you read that right. Zero cost software. 
  
  %p 
    Because you are using open source software, there's no up front cost for the software. There's also no annual maintenance fees. And, if you 
    need to make a software upgrade, there's no charge for that either. If you want to plug in some software pieces that you've already paid for,
    that's okay too.
  
  %p <i>You only pay for the services work to build what you need.</i>
  
  %p 
    <i>[insert name here]</i> is built for companies that need 
    %a.popper{href: '#',
      'data-original-title' => 'Our Solution Includes',
      'data-content' => '<ul><li>a data warehouse<li>...</ul>'} a powerful reporting solution
    but without the huge costs required to just get a foot in the door.

  .annotation.s 
    maybe the paragraph below is better for the micro site?
  %p
    If you choose to go with a custom solution with us, you get a data warehouse from the get go. Instead of using some meta-tool like a
    "framework manager" and having to continually tweak it to make it give you the proper results quickly, we do direct transformation of your data in
    a data warehouse. This is faster, more maintainable, and more reliable. It's also cheaper to develop, believe it or not. We use advanced licence free
    software wherever possible which minimizes your implementation costs.

  %h2 Finding it harder and harder to keep your projects under control? We've got something for that too.
  
  %p Assign it to me is a online management tool that helps teams deliver profitable projects on time and on budget.
  %p
    Assign It To Me might look like a project management tool on the surface, but it's much deeper than that. In our previous lives, we've had to deal with
    a hodge podge of applications to handle project management, time keeping and status reporting. And even with those applications, it required even more work to
    keep an eye on how the company was doing as a whole. Well, we got tired of the status quo and decided to build a solution from the ground up. Unlike other
    "project management" solutions, however, we didn't want to build an overglorified to do list. Our background is in analytics. If we're going to build a system,
    we're going to use the data from the system to give our users insight.
  %p
    Assign It To Me was born. Currently in alpha, Assign It To Me is an analytics driven tool for services companies. Yes, it helps you run your projects,
    but it also gives you a bigger picture view and helps you manage the profitability of your consulting shop.
  %p
    We all know that delivering a successful project is the primary focus for project managers and their teams. They should not be wasting valuable time on administrative tasks
    when there is more important work to do.
  %p
    All managers are aware that administrative tasks should be kept to a minimum and Assign It To Me does that with an easy to use workspace. Project managers can see how their project is progressing with
    integrated status reports and project health dashboards. Team members no longer have to use multiple systems on a project. Task management, communication,
    timekeeping, status reports, scope control and work load are all integrated into one tool.
  %p If you're a project manager who cares about saving money on your projects, Assign It To Me can help.

    One more thing. We want to do everything possible to make your services projects successful. For every customer that signs up for our services, we'll
    also sign them up for a free one-year subscription for X project managers to our project management app
    %a{href: "http://assignittome.com"} Assign It To Me
    (that's a ## savings). Use it to manage
    all you projects forever.
